# Flask_Sql
A flask based sql insertion-extraction code


This repo has been created for use in updataion of SQL tables over servers.
The app.py is a flask framework based program that contains a bunch of apis for insertion and injection to tabels in a SQL database, you will have to edit the paths-names for the tables or edit the table names as per your requirements.
The app.py also has a query retrieval API, you will have edit the code based on your table and your query requirements.

The requests.py program contains all the requests that you could use with this flask program.
Edit the requests if you are using different data, and call the necessary function. Better yet, include batteries in the code for easy functon calling.

NOTE: All the programs here have been created for the data1.csv file provided, any other data file would require the necessary edits.
